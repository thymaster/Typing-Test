No one\r\n        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,\r\n        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally\r\n        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there\r\n        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because\r\n        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil\r\n        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,\r\n        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to\r\n        obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with\r\n        a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,\r\n        or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney\r\n        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,\r\n        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of\r\n        the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.\r\n        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the\r\n        Renaissance.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n","export const quotesArray = [\r\n  {\r\n    quote:\r\n      \"If we listened to our intellect we'd never have a love affair.
